# 🕳️ HOLE-DETECTION-ALGORITHM

*NOTE: During my experience in the mining sector, I participated in the development of a visual inspection system using machine vision to detect damage on conveyor belts used to move minerals. Out of respect for confidentiality, no images or technical details of the actual system are included. The documentation presented here is a representative simulation developed by me for demonstration purposes.*

This project presents a computer vision algorithm designed to detect damage on conveyor belts used to move minerals in the mining industry. The system is optimized for harsh industrial environments, where factors such as water, shadows, inconsistent lighting, and dust can make visual inspection difficult. The algorithm is particularly robust because it has demonstrated the ability to work well even in unfavorable environments, such as incorrect lighting, sunlight, water presence, and many shadows.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a reliable and efficient algorithm capable of detecting **holes, tears, or damage** on conveyor belts transporting minerals, using image processing and analysis techniques.

| Discharging                                                                                    |

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Techniques like grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and edge detection are applied.

3. **Damage Detection**  
   The algorithm searches for abnormal contours or holes based on shape, texture, and context.

4. **Postprocessing & Output**  
   The system highlights detected damage areas and generates visual reports or alerts.

## 📊 IMPACT

- ⏱️ **Reduced Inspection Time**  
  By automating the visual inspection process, the algorithm significantly decreases the time required for manual belt monitoring.

- 🔧 **Improved Maintenance Efficiency**  
  Early detection of belt damage allows maintenance teams to plan interventions in advance, reducing unexpected downtime and costly repairs.

- 🧯 **Enhanced Operator Safety**  
  Minimizing the need for manual inspection in high-risk zones reduces worker exposure to potentially hazardous environments.

- 🛠️ **Adaptable to Harsh Conditions**  
  The system has proven reliable under industrial conditions, including sunlight, water presence, poor lighting, and shadows.

- 📈 **Scalable to Multiple Conveyor Lines**  
  The approach can be deployed across different plants and conveyor configurations with minimal calibration.
