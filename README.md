# HOLE-DETECTION-ALGORITHM
The algorithm's goal is to find damages on a conveyor belt used to move minerals, using image processing techniques. The algorithm is particularly robust because it has demonstrated the ability to work well even in unfavorable environments, such as incorrect lighting, sunlight, water presence, and many shadows.
